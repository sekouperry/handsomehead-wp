== FAQs ==

= Does the Setmore plugin have any dependencies? =

The Setmore plugin uses jQuery, jQuery easing, and FancyBox’s JavaScript and stylesheet. We automatically register these scripts and stylesheets with WordPress as part of the plugin.

= Can I customize the way the ‘Book Now’ button looks? =

Yes. While Setmore offers a default visual for your booking button, it is simply an image file that links to your Booking Page. You can easily replace your button’s image.

Head to Apps & Integrations > Your Booking Page (Configure) > Company Details. Here, you’ll be able to customize your Booking Page with your logo and contact details.

= Can I remove the Setmore logo and branding from my Booking Page? =
